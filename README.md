# Synthesizing Fingerprint Images

This code helps in generating Synthetic data for fingerprints. GAN is used to build the model.  

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 1.x
* Tensorpack 0.5
* Numpy
* Scipy

## Pretrained Model

Please download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GzSzu9SXAgjgnnENXzKT41gR6_6uWcSd?usp=sharing). Please extract the zipped file into ``model`` directory in root.

## How to use the model

You can download the model from above google drive link. Please update the arguments in Improved-WGAN.py file according to the path were dataset is stored and output path where synthetic fingerprint images needs to be stored.
In the 3rd argument you can specify the total number of synthetic fingerprints you need.
