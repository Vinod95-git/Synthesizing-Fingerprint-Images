# Synthesizing Fingerprint Images

This code helps in generating Synthetic data for fingerprints. GAN is used to build the model.  

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 
* Tensorpack 0.5
* Numpy
* Scipy

## Pretrained Model

Please download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GzSzu9SXAgjgnnENXzKT41gR6_6uWcSd?usp=sharing). Please extract the zipped file into ``model`` directory in root.

## How to use the model

You can download the model from above google drive link. Please update the arguments in Improved-WGAN.py file according to the path were dataset is stored and output path where synthetic fingerprint images needs to be stored.
